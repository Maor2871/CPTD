Welcome to Cheese Party TD

1. Start the Cheese Party TD Server.exe file on a windows machine connected to the internet.

2. Find the ip address of the machine which the server is currently running on:

	- If the sever is running on a local machine, find the ip of the server by entering the command "ipconfig" in the command line of the server machine.

	- If the server is running on a remote machine, find the ip of the server by searching "what is my ip adress" in a search engine, e.g. google.

3. Start the Cheese Party TD.exe file, write the ip address of the server and press enter.

4. Start the Cheese Party TD.exe file on a different machine, enter the same server ip.

5. Play.

Note: make sure that the 3 .dll files are within the same directory as the .exe files.
